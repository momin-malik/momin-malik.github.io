<blockquote>
<a href="https://erowid.org">Erowid.org</a> is a website dedicated to documenting information about psychoactive substances, with over 36,000 user-submitted drug Experience Reports. We study the potential of these reports to provide information about characteristic experiences with drugs. First, we assess different kinds of drug experiences, such as &lsquo;addiction&rsquo; or &lsquo;bad trips&rsquo;. We quantitatively analyze how such experiences are related to substances and user variables. Furthermore, we classify positive and negative experiences as well as reported addiction using information about the consumer, substance, context and location of the drug experience. While variables based only on objective characteristics yield poor predictive performance for subjective experiences, we find subjective user reports can help to identify new patterns and impact factors on drug experiences. In particular, we found a positive association between addiction experiences and dextromethorphan, a substance with largely unknown withdrawal effects. Our research can help to gain a deeper sociological understanding of drug consumption and to identify relationships which may have clinical relevance. Moreover, it can show how non-mainstream social media platforms can be utilized to study characteristics of human behavior and how this can be done in an ethical way in collaboration with the platform providers.

<blockquote>
Objective: Artificial intelligence (AI) models may propagate harmful biases in performance and hence negatively affect the underserved. We aimed to assess the degree to which data quality of electronic health records (EHRs) affected by inequities related to low socioeconomic status (SES), results in differential performance of AI models across SES.
<br><br>
Materials and Methods: This study utilized existing machine learning models for predicting asthma exacerbation in children with asthma. We compared balanced error rate (BER) against different SES levels measured by HOUsing-based SocioEconomic Status measure (HOUSES) index. As a possible mechanism for differential performance, we also compared incompleteness of EHR information relevant to asthma care by SES.
<br><br>
Results: Asthmatic children with lower SES had larger BER than those with higher SES (eg, ratio = 1.35 for HOUSES Q1 vs Q2-Q4) and had a higher proportion of missing information relevant to asthma care (eg, 41% vs 24% for missing asthma severity and 12% vs 9.8% for undiagnosed asthma despite meeting asthma criteria).
<br><br>
Discussion: Our study suggests that lower SES is associated with worse predictive model performance. It also highlights the potential role of incomplete EHR data in this differential performance and suggests a way to mitigate this bias.
<br><br>
Conclusion: The HOUSES index allows AI researchers to assess bias in predictive model performance by SES. Although our case study was based on a small sample size and a single-site study, the study results highlight a potential strategy for identifying bias by using an innovative SES measure.

<blockquote>
Starting with Philip E. Agre&rsquo;s 1997 essay on &ldquo;critical technical practice&rdquo;, we consider examples of writings from computer science where authors describe &ldquo;waking up&rdquo; from a previously narrow technical approach to the world, enabling them to recognize how their previous efforts towards social change had been ineffective. We use these examples first to talk about the underlying assumptions of a technology-centric approach to social problems, and second to theorize these awakenings in terms of Paulo Freire&rsquo;s idea of <i>critical consciousness</i>. Specifically, understanding these awakenings among technical practitioners as examples of this more general phenomenon gives guidance for how we might encourage and guide critical awakenings in order to get more technologists working effectively towards positive social change.

<blockquote>
To those involved in discussions about rigor, reproducibility, and replication in science, conversation about the &ldquo;reproducibility crisis&rdquo; appear ill-structured. Seemingly very different issues concerning the purity of reagents, accessibility of computational code, or misaligned incentives in academic research writ large are all collected up under this label. Prior work has attempted to address this problem by creating analytical definitions of reproducibility. We take a novel empirical, mixed methods approach to understanding variation in reproducibility discussions, using a combination of grounded theory and correspondence analysis to examine how a variety of authors narrate the story of the reproducibility crisis. Contrary to expectations, this analysis demonstrates that there is a clear thematic core to reproducibility discussions, centered on the incentive structure of science, the transparency of methods and data, and the need to reform academic publishing. However, we also identify three clusters of discussion that are distinct from the main body of articles: one focused on reagents, another on statistical methods, and a final cluster focused on the heterogeneity of the natural world. Although there are discursive differences between scientific and popular articles, we find no strong differences in how scientists and journalists write about the reproducibility crisis. Our findings demonstrate the value of using qualitative methods to identify the bounds and features of reproducibility discourse, and identify distinct vocabularies and constituencies that reformers should engage with to promote change.

<blockquote>
Background: In the United States, Black Americans are suffering from a significantly disproportionate incidence of COVID-19. Going beyond mere epidemiological tallying, the potential for actual racial-justice interventions, including reparations payments, to ameliorate these disparities has not been adequately explored.
<br><br>
Methods: We compared the COVID-19 time-varying <i>R<sub>t</sub></i>&ensp;curves of relatively disparate polities in terms of social equity (South Korea vs. Louisiana). Next, we considered a range of reproductive ratios to back-calculate the transmission rates <i>&beta;</i><sub><i>i</i>&rarr;<i>j</i></sub>&ensp;for 4 cells of the simplified next-generation matrix (from which <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is calculated for structured models) for the outbreak in Louisiana. Lastly, we modeled the effect that monetary payments as reparations for Black American descendants of persons enslaved in the U.S. would have had on pre-intervention <i>&beta;</i><sub><i>i</i>&rarr;<i>j</i></sub> and consequently <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>. 
<br><br>
Results: Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays <i>R<sub>t</sub></i>&ensp;values with an absolute difference of 1.3 to 2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring <i>R<sub>t</sub></i>&ensp;below 1. Reasoning through the consequences of increased equity via matrix transmission models, we demonstrate how the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio <i>&beta;</i><sub><i>b</i>&rarr;<i>b</i></sub> / <i>&beta;</i><sub><i>w</i>&rarr;<i>w</i></sub>) could reduce <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> by 31 to 68%. 
<br><br>
Discussion: While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial injustice interventions such as reparations, our study describes potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. A restitutive program targeted towards Black individuals would not only decrease COVID-19 risk for recipients of the wealth redistribution; the mitigating effects would be distributed across racial groups, benefitting the population at large.

<p>Kar-Hai Chu, Jason Colditz, <b>Momin M. Malik</b>, Tabitha Yates, and Brian Primack. 2019. Identifying key target audiences for public health campaigns: Leveraging machine learning in the case of hookah tobacco smoking. <i>Journal of Medical Internet Research</i> 21 (7), e12443. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/12443">10.2196/12443</a>. [<a href="https://www.jmir.org/2019/7/e12443/">JMIR link</a>]</p>
<blockquote>Background: Hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) is a particularly important issue for public health professionals to address owing to its prevalence and deleterious health effects. Social media sites can be a valuable tool for public health officials to conduct informational health campaigns. Current social media platforms provide researchers with opportunities to better identify and target specific audiences and even individuals. However, we are not aware of systematic research attempting to identify audiences with mixed or ambivalent views toward HTS.
<br><br>
Objective: The objective of this study was to (1) confirm previous research showing positively skewed HTS sentiment on Twitter using a larger dataset by leveraging machine learning techniques and (2) systematically identify individuals who exhibit mixed opinions about HTS via the Twitter platform and therefore represent key audiences for intervention.
<br><br>
Methods: We prospectively collected tweets related to HTS from January to June 2016. We double-coded sentiment for a subset of approximately 5000 randomly sampled tweets for sentiment toward HTS and used these data to train a machine learning classifier to assess the remaining approximately 556,000 HTS-related Twitter posts. Natural language processing software was used to extract linguistic features (ie, language-based covariates). The data were processed by machine learning tools and algorithms using R. Finally, we used the results to identify individuals who, because they had consistently posted both positive and negative content, might be ambivalent toward HTS and represent an ideal audience for intervention.
<br><br>
Results: There were 561,960 HTS-related tweets: 373,911 were classified as positive and 183,139 were classified as negative. A set of 12,861 users met a priori criteria indicating that they posted both positive and negative tweets about HTS.
<br><br>
Conclusions: Sentiment analysis can allow researchers to identify audience segments on social media that demonstrate ambiguity toward key public health issues, such as HTS, and therefore represent ideal populations for intervention. Using large social media datasets can help public health officials to preemptively identify specific audience segments that would be most receptive to targeted campaigns.

<blockquote>Abstract: Large-scale digital trace data from sources such as social media platforms, emails, purchase records, browsing behavior, and sensors in mobile phones are increasingly used for business decision-making, scientific research, and even public policy. However, these data do not give an unbiased picture of underlying phenomena. In this thesis, I demonstrate some of the ways in which large-scale digital trace data, despite its richness, has biases in who is represented, what sorts of actions are represented, and what sorts of behaviors are captured. I present three critiques, demonstrating respectively that geotagged tweets exhibit heavy geographic and demographic biases, that social media platforms&rsquo;s attempts to guide user behavior are successful and have implications for the behavior we think we observe, and that sensors built into mobile phones like Bluetooth and WiFi measure proximity and co-location but not necessarily interaction as has been claimed.
<br><br>
In response to these biases, I suggest shifting the scope of research done with digital trace data away from attempts at large-sample statistical generalizability and towards studies that situate knowledge in the contexts in which the data were collected. Specifically, I present two studies demonstrating alternatives to complement each of the critiques. In the first, I work with public health researchers to use Twitter as a means of public outreach and intervention. In the second, I design a study using mobile phone sensors in which I use sensor data and survey data to respectively measure proximity and sociometric choice, and model the relationship between the two.

<blockquote>Excerpt: To the two traditional modes of doing science, in vivo (observation) and in vitro (experimentation), has been added &ldquo;in silico&rdquo;: computer simulation. It has become routine in the natural sciences, as well as in systems planning and business process management (Baines et al. 2004; Laguna and Marklund 2013; Paul et al. 1999) to recreate the dynamics of physical systems in computer code. The code is then executed to give outputs that describe how a system evolves from given inputs. Simulation models of simple physical processes, like boiling water or materials rupturing, give precise outputs that reliably match the outcomes of the actual physical system. However, as Winsberg (2010, p. 71) argues, scientists who rely on simulations do so because they &ldquo;assume as background knowledge that we already know a great deal about how to build good models of the very features of the target system that we are interested in learning about.&rdquo; This is not the case with social simulation. It is often done precisely to try and discover the important features of the target system when those features are unknown or uncertain. Social simulation is a kind of computer-aided thought experiment (Di Paolo et al. 2000) and as such, it is most appropriate to use as a &ldquo;method of theory development&rdquo; (Gilbert and Troitzsch 2005). Unlike in the natural sciences, uncertainty and the impossibility of verification are the rule rather than the exception, and so it is rare to find attempts to use social simulation for prediction and forecasting (Feder 2002).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Abstract: Even when external researchers have access to social media data, they are not privy to decisions that went into platform design—including the measurement and testing that goes into deploying new platform features, such as recommender systems, that seek to shape user behavior towards desirable ends. Finding ways to identify platform effects is thus important both for generalizing findings, as well as understanding the nature of platform usage. One approach is to find temporal data covering the introduction of a new feature; observing differences in behavior before and after allow us to estimate the effect of the change. We investigate platform effects using two such datasets, the Netflix Prize dataset and the Facebook New Orleans data, in which we observe seeming discontinuities in user behavior but that we know or suspect are the result of a change in platform design. For the Netflix Prize, we estimate user ratings changing by an average of about 3% after the change, and in Facebook New Orleans, we find that the introduction of the &lsquo;People You May Know&rsquo; feature locally nearly doubled the average number of edges added daily, and increased by 63% the average proportion of triangles created by each new edge. Our work empirically verifies several previously expressed theoretical concerns, and gives insight into the magnitude and variety of platform effects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Abstract: Previous literature has considered the relevance of Twitter to journalism, for example as a tool for reporters to collect information and for organizations to disseminate news to the public. We consider the reciprocal perspective, carrying out a survey of news media-related content within Twitter. Using a random sample of 1.8 billion tweets over four months in 2014, we look at the distribution of activity across news media and the relative dominance of certain news organizations in terms of relative share of content, the Twitter behavior of news media, the hashtags used in news content versus Twitter as a whole, and the proportion of Twitter activity that is news media-related. We find a small but consistent proportion of Twitter is news media-related (0.8 percent by volume); that news media-related tweets focus on a different set of hashtags than Twitter as a whole, with some hashtags such as those of countries of conflict (Arab Spring countries, Ukraine) reaching over 15 percent of tweets being news media-related; and we find that news organizations&rsquo; accounts, across all major organizations, largely use Twitter as a professionalized, one-way communication medium to promote their own reporting. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling, we also examine how the proportion of news content varies across topics within 100,000 #Egypt tweets, finding that the relative proportion of news media-related tweets varies vastly across different subtopics. Over-time analysis reveals that news media were among the earliest adopters of certain #Egypt subtopics, providing a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for influence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Abstract: &lsquo;Firestorms,&rsquo; sudden bursts of negative attention in cases of controversy and outrage, are seemingly widespread on Twitter and are an increasing source of fascination and anxiety in the corporate, governmental, and public spheres. Using media mentions, we collect 80 candidate events from January 2011 to September 2014 that we would term &lsquo;firestorms.&rsquo; Using data from the Twitter decahose (or gardenhose), a 10% random sample of all tweets, we describe the size and longevity of these firestorms. We take two firestorm exemplars, #myNYPD and #CancelColbert, as case studies to describe more fully. Then, taking the 20 firestorms with the most tweets, we look at the change in mention networks of participants over the course of the firestorm as one method of testing for possible impacts of firestorms. We find that the mention networks before and after the firestorms are more similar to each other than to those of the firestorms, suggesting that firestorms neither emerge from existing networks, nor do they result in lasting changes to social structure. To verify this, we randomly sample users and generate mention networks for baseline comparison, and find that the firestorms are not associated with a greater than random amount of change in mention networks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Abstract: Geotagged tweets are an exciting and increasingly popular data source, but like all social media data, they potentially have biases in who are represented. Motivated by this, we investigate the question, &lsquo;are users of geotagged tweets randomly distributed over the US population&rsquo;? We link approximately 144 million geotagged tweets within the US, representing 2.6m unique users, to high-resolution Census population data and carry out a statistical test by which we answer this question strongly in the negative. We utilize spatial models and integrate further Census data to investigate the factors associated with this nonrandom distribution. We find that, controlling for other factors, population has no effect on the number of geotag users, and instead it is predicted by a number of factors including higher median income, being in an urban area, being further east or on a coast, having more young people, and having high Asian, Black or Hispanic/Latino populations.</blockquote>

<p><b>Momin M. Malik</b>, Afsaneh Doryab, Michael Merrill, J&uuml;rgen Pfeffer, and Anind K. Dey. 2020. Can smartphone co-locations detect friendship? It depends how you model it. In submission. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02919">arXiv:2008.02919</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
We present a study to detect friendship, its strength, and its change from smartphone location data collected among members of a fraternity. We extract a rich set of co-location features and build classifiers that detect friendships and close friendship at 30% above a random baseline. We design cross-validation schema to test our model performance in specific application settings, finding it robust to seeing new dyads and to temporal variance.

<p><b>Momin M. Malik</b>. 2020. A hierarchy of limitations in machine learning. In submission. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05193">arXiv:2002.05193</a>]</p>
<blockquote>
&ldquo;All models are wrong, but some are useful,&rdquo; wrote George E. P. Box (1979). Machine learning has focused on the <i>usefulness</i> of probability models for prediction in social systems, but is only now coming to grips with the ways in which these models are <i>wrong</i>&mdash;and the consequences of those shortcomings. This paper attempts a comprehensive, structured overview of the specific conceptual, procedural, and statistical limitations of models in machine learning when applied to society. Machine learning modelers themselves can use the described hierarchy to identify possible failure points and think through how to address them, and consumers of machine learning models can know what to question when confronted with the decision about if, where, and how to apply machine learning. The limitations go from commitments inherent in quantification itself, through to showing how unmodeled dependencies can lead to cross-validation being overly optimistic as a way of assessing model performance.
